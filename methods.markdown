# Methods!

Methods are actions that can be called on objects. They are the way to interact with objects.  Each class has its own set of methods.

### module methods
Module methods begin with `self.`
I think that module methods only work within their module.  Maybe this is useful if you want ot keep data in a specific module and not share it with the rest of the program.
